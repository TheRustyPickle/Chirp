Chirp is my playground for exploring the world of GTK4-rs while working on a chat application. Currently, it's a practice project with a straightforward and functional UI.

## Features

üé® **User Interface:** Chirp features an interface crafted using GTK4-rs.

üåê **Server:** A WebSocket server created with actix-web the GUI can communicate with, allowing usage of multiple clients with auto-reconnecting.

üõ°Ô∏è **Security:** The application incorporates several security measures, including TLS-encrypted server communication and token-based authentication for the GUI client.

üí¨ **Messaging:** The app supports basic messaging capabilities including sending and deleting messages, adding new chat, and message synchronization upon startup.

üîí **Message Encryption:** A combination of RSA and AES is used to add encryption to every single message and is decrypted locally to show it in the UI.

## Current Status

No further development is planned for the project as it served its purpose

## Project Components

- `gui/`: Contains the UI interface built with GTK4-rs along with all the logic and UI components to make it run.
- `server/`: Hosts a WebSocket server created with actix-web, facilitating communication with the GUI and managing the DB.
- `migrations/`: Contains DB migrations details, should be handled with diesel-rs

## Explore the Project

- Clone this project onto your local machine `git clone https://github.com/TheRustyPickle/Chirp.git`.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies, including the latest GTK4, Libadwaita libraries, and Postgres.
- Install diesel cli `cargo install diesel_cli`
- Update Postgres credentials on `.env` file
- Setup DB and run migrations

```bash
diesel setup
diesel migration run
```

- Setup GTK Schema settings

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
cp ./gui/src/com.github.therustypickle.chirp.gschema.xml $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
glib-compile-schemas $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
```

- Start the server `cargo run --bin chirp-server --release`
- Launch the GUI using the command `cargo run --bin chirp-gui --release`
